        "extract": "<p> </p> <p><i><b>Catch-22</b></i> is a satirical war novel by American author Joseph Heller. It is his debut novel. He began writing it in 1953; the novel was first published in 1961. Often cited as one of the most significant novels of the twentieth century, it uses a distinctive non-chronological third-person omniscient narration, describing events from the points of view of different characters. The separate storylines are out of sequence so the timeline develops along with the plot. </p><p>The novel is set during World War II, from 1942 to 1944. It mainly follows the life of antihero Captain John Yossarian, a U.S. Army Air Forces B-25 bombardier. Most of the events in the book occur while the fictional 256th US Army Air Squadron is based on the island of Pianosa, in the Mediterranean Sea west of the Italian mainland, although it also includes episodes from basic training at Lowry Field in Colorado and Air Corps training at Santa Ana Army Air Base in California. The novel examines the absurdity of war and military life through the experiences of Yossarian and his cohorts, who attempt to maintain their sanity while fulfilling their service requirements so that they may return home. </p><p>The book was made into a film adaptation in 1970, directed by Mike Nichols, and a Hulu miniseries in 2019, produced by George Clooney. In 1994, Heller published a sequel to the novel entitled <i>Closing Time</i>. </p>",

The book won the National Book Award and Pulitzer Prize for fiction, and it was cited prominently when Steinbeck was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1962. </p><p>Set during the Great Depression, the novel focuses on the Joads, a poor family of tenant farmers driven from their Oklahoma home by drought, economic hardship, agricultural industry changes, and bank foreclosures forcing tenant farmers out of work. Due to their nearly hopeless situation, and in part because they are trapped in the Dust Bowl, the Joads set out for California on the \"mother road\", along with thousands of other \"Okies\" seeking jobs, land, dignity, and a future. </p><p><i>The Grapes of Wrath</i> is frequently read in American high school and college literature classes due to its historical context and enduring legacy. A celebrated Hollywood film version, starring Henry Fonda and directed by John Ford, was released in 1940. </p>",

It is the first novel in the <i>Remembrance of Earth's Past</i> trilogy. The series portrays a fictional past, present, and future wherein Earth encounters an alien civilization from a nearby system of three Sun-like stars orbiting one another, a representative example of the three-body problem in orbital mechanics. </p><p>The story was originally serialized in <i>Science Fiction World</i> in 2006 before it was published as a standalone book in 2008. In 2006, it received the Galaxy Award for Chinese science fiction. In 2012, it was described as one of China's most successful full-length novels of the past two decades. The English translation by Ken Liu was published by Tor Books in 2014. That translation was the first novel by an Asian writer to win a Hugo Award for Best Novel; it was also nominated for the Nebula Award for Best Novel. </p><p>The book has been adapted into other media. In 2015, a Chinese film adaptation of the same name was in production, but it was never released. A Chinese TV series, <i>Three-Body</i>, released in early 2023 to critical success locally.

Stephenson wrote about the Macintosh \"When the computer crashed and wrote gibberish into the bitmap, the result was something that looked vaguely like static on a broken television set—a 'snow crash'\". Stephenson has also mentioned that Julian Jaynes' book <i>The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind</i> was one of the main influences on <i>Snow Crash</i>. </p><p><i>Snow Crash</i> was nominated for both the British Science Fiction Award in 1993 and the Arthur C.

        "title": "Watchmen",
        "extract": "<p> </p> <p><i><b>Watchmen</b></i> is a comic book limited series by the British creative team of writer Alan Moore, artist Dave Gibbons and colorist John Higgins. It was published monthly by DC Comics in 1986 and 1987 before being collected in a single-volume edition in 1987. <i>Watchmen</i> originated from a story proposal Moore submitted to DC featuring superhero characters that the company had acquired from Charlton Comics. As Moore's proposed story would have left many of the characters unusable for future stories, managing editor Dick Giordano convinced Moore to create original characters instead. </p><p>Moore used the story as a means of reflecting contemporary anxieties, deconstructing and satirizing the superhero concept and making political commentary. <i>Watchmen</i> depicts an alternate history in which superheroes emerged in the 1940s and 1960s and their presence changed history so that the United States won the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal was never exposed. In 1985, the country is edging toward World War III with the Soviet Union, freelance costumed vigilantes have been outlawed and most former superheroes are in retirement or working for the government. The story focuses on the protagonists' personal development and moral struggles as an investigation into the murder of a government-sponsored superhero pulls them out of retirement. </p><p>Gibbons uses a nine-panel grid layout throughout the series and adds recurring symbols such as a blood-stained smiley face. All but the last issue feature supplemental fictional documents that add to the series' backstory and the narrative is intertwined with that of another story, an in-story pirate comic titled <i>Tales of the Black Freighter</i>, which one of the characters reads. Structured at times as a nonlinear narrative, the story skips through space, time and plot. In the same manner, entire scenes and dialogues have parallels with others through synchronicity, coincidence, and repeated imagery. </p><p>A commercial success, <i>Watchmen</i> has received critical acclaim both in the comics and mainstream press. <i>Watchmen</i> was recognized in <i>Time</i>'s List of the 100 Best Novels as one of the best English language novels published since 1923. In a retrospective review, the BBC's Nicholas Barber described it as \"the moment comic books grew up\". Moore opposed this idea, stating, \"I tend to think that, no, comics hadn't grown up. There were a few titles that were more adult than people were used to. But the majority of comics titles were pretty much the same as they'd ever been. It wasn't comics growing up. I think it was more comics meeting the emotional age of the audience coming the other way.\" </p><p>After several attempts to adapt the series into a feature film, director Zack Snyder's <i>Watchmen</i> was released in 2009. An episodic video game, <i>Watchmen: The End Is Nigh</i>, was released to coincide with the film's release. </p><p>DC Comics published <i>Before Watchmen</i>, a series of nine prequel miniseries, in 2012, and <i>Doomsday Clock</i>, a 12-issue limited series and sequel to the original <i>Watchmen</i> series, from 2017 to 2019 – both without Moore's or Gibbons' involvement. The second series integrated the <i>Watchmen</i> characters within the DC Universe. A standalone sequel, <i>Rorschach</i> by Tom King, began publication in October 2020. A television continuation to the original comic, set 34 years after the comic's timeline, was broadcast on HBO from October to December 2019 with Gibbons' involvement. Moore has expressed his displeasure with adaptations and sequels of <i>Watchmen</i> and asked it not be used for future works. </p>",

The book details the conflict between two rival gangs of White Americans divided by their socioeconomic status: the working-class \"Greasers\" and the upper-middle-class \"Socs\" (pronounced <i>SOH-shiz</i>—short for <i>Socials</i>). The story is told in first-person perspective by teenage protagonist Ponyboy Curtis, and takes place in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in 1965, although this is never explicitly stated in the book. </p><p>Hinton began writing the novel when she was 15 and wrote the bulk of it when she was 16 and a junior in high school. She was 18 when the book was published.

It was Percy's first, most famous, and most widely praised novel, and established him as one of the major voices in Southern literature.

Largely set in a futuristic World State, whose citizens are environmentally engineered into an intelligence-based social hierarchy, the novel anticipates huge scientific advancements in reproductive technology, sleep-learning, psychological manipulation and classical conditioning that are combined to make a dystopian society which is challenged by the story's protagonist. Huxley followed this book with a reassessment in essay form, <i>Brave New World Revisited</i> (1958), and with his final novel, <i>Island</i> (1962), the utopian counterpart.
